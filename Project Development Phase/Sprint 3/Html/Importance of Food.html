healthy,to move, play, work, think and learn. Foods are directly related to our body and mental and social health because each food or liquid contain
particular nutrition such as carbohydrates, protein, vitamins, minerals, fats, etc, which are very necessary for our physical and mental growth.

On the contrary, they lead to health problems such as diabetes and heart disease. Therefore, you should choose healthy and balanced foods that can 
provide enough nutritional value ​​for the body.</p>

<img src="images/frrrr.JPG" >
<p>    Food is the third most important thing for living beings to provide energy and development, maintain life, or stimulate growth after 
air and water In fact, it is one of the most complicated sets of chemicals. Food plays an important role in the promotion of health and disease 
prevention.In general, it consists of essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals and vitamins which are consumed to provide 
nutritionalsupport for an organism and ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to sustain health. These nutritious foods are in the form
of grains, pulses, fruits, vegetables, oils, etc.

              We must know that the terms ‘food’ and ‘nutrition’ are sometimes used synonymously, which is not correct completely.Food is a composite
mixture of various ingredients that are consumed for nutrition. On the other hand, nutrition connotes a dynamic process in which swallowed food is 
utilized by the human body for nourishment.As much as we eat, our body gets nourished. When there is an insufficient intake of protein, energy or 
carbohydrate,there is often illness or infection.</p>

<img src="images/pastries.jpg" width=50%  height=20% >
<p>Foods are secured through several methods: agriculture, hunting, gathering, etc. The detailed statement is that most food has its origin in plants. 

Some food is derived directly from plants, but even animals are also used as food sources that are picked up by feeding food from plants. 
Some foods are not directly obtained from animal or plant sources they are obtained from various edible fungi, especially mushrooms.
Fungi and ambient bacteria are used in the preparation of fermented and pickled foods like leavened bread, alcoholic drinks, cheese, pickles, etc. 
Another example is blue-green algae such as Spirulina. Inorganic substances such as baking soda, salt, and tartar cream are used to preserve or
chemically convert a component.</p>

<h1><u>How Does Healthy Eating Affect Our Physical, Mental and Social Health?</u></h1>
<p>We all know very well foods are very important and we consume them in our daily life, foods affect our body and our mental and social
health because each food or liquid contain particular nutrition which is very important for our physical and mental development. 
Whenever we take any food or nutritious fluid, our bodies digest and absorb simple but essential minerals, vitamins, fats, proteins, carbohydrates,
fats, and water from these meals or nourishing liquids and convert that into the bloodstream and energy that help our body to stimulate growth and 
keep it healthy. 
Let's say, foods have various roles in human life so they are quite interesting and worth reading.
<pre><big>         ⇒Our body is just like a machine; like an engine burning fuel, the work of the body due to the energy supplied from food. 
The food we take in our nutrition acts as a fuel to generate energy in the mitochondria. Glucose from food interacts with oxygen to form energy,
Carbon dioxide, and water molecules. Our body uses the consumption of food in order to generate the driving forces to keep the lungs breathing the
 heart beating and the limb function.

                  ⇒We go to the gym and do strenuous exercise for bodybuilding, in this process, we need protein. 
So gym instructors give us the advice to take those nutrients to consume a high diet containing foods. 
For this purpose, protein-rich foods such as pulses, milk, eggs, vitamin-rich vegetables, and meat are recommended to help build enough muscles and
get the perfect body.

                  ⇒The food contains proteins that provide amino acids for digestion. These amino acids build proteins and fill a variety of roles,
from supporting metabolism to protecting our heart.The proteins are life-sustaining macronutrients which act to build body cells and other tissues
to maintain shape and function.Our body also uses amino acids for energy when you lack carbs and fats.

                 ⇒When we feel sick, we take food and medicine to be cured and healed, if we eat sufficient food, our immunity boosts up and we feel
relieved from a cough, cold-like symptoms to a recognizable extent.Even in most infections, diseases or illnesses, the patients become very weak
because they have stopped or are reluctant to eat.

                 ⇒Nutrition deficiency is a sort of disease wherein a lack of food or excess food causes the disorder. 
The lack of sufficient diet along with the administration of drugs leads to many problems like drug accumulation, development of resistance to the 
drug by microbes, etc.This is because the food is an enzyme inducer. Thus on metabolism drugs become more water-soluble and get excreted from urine.
Food gives strength to the body to accommodate a drug and medicine safely and also metabolize them after their action in the body. 
Many oil-soluble medicines are well absorbed in the presence of fatty foods.

                 ⇒During a wound, bone fracture or inflammation, consuming a sufficient diet helps to overcome the pain and inconvenience during the
healing process. It indicates that food is also used as medicine drugs, without food drugs fail to overcome some diseases like tuberculosis,sunstroke,
gastric ulcers, skin diseases, muscle pains, etc.So, one of the best techniques to overcome diseases is to have a reasonable amount of food.

                 ⇒Many people under stress and depression neglect food. But interestingly the same food can relieve stress and strain. 
So if you are having any tension, then ask him to consume enough food and you will see that he gets some relief from stress and depression.By the way
the importance of food is apparent, yet we have tried to write on this topic, someone might be able to benefit from this article and he may include me
in his prayers.
